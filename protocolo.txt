Notation: AES(m,k) = Encrypt message m with key k, {m}pk+(X) = encrypt message m with X's public key.

Key creation and uploading
1. Alice generates pk+(A), pk-(A)
2. Alice generates password (AP). Encrypts mk(A) = AES(pk-(A),AP)
3. Alice uploads (mk(A), pk+(A)) to server.
4. Concurrently, Bob does the same [ BP, mk(B), pk+(B) ]. 
At this point, Server has pk+(B), pk+(A), mk(A), mk(B).

Then, Alice wants to message (m) Bob 
1. Alice asks for pk+(B) from server.
2. Alice generates C = {m}pk+(B)
3. Alice uploads C to server, tells server to send to Bob.

Now, Bob has the message.
1. Deciphers mk(B) with BP, obtains pk-(B)
2. Deciphers C with pk-(B), obtains m.
